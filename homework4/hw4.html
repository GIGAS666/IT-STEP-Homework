                    <p class="section">Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German
                        composer and
                        musician of the Baroque period. He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Art of
                        Fugue,
                        the Brandenburg Concertos, and the Goldberg Variations, and for vocal music such as the St
                        Matthew
                        Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has been generally
                        regarded
                        as one of the greatest composers of the Western art musical canon.</p>

                    <p class="section">The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born
                        as the last
                        child
                        of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at age 10, he lived for five years with his
                        eldest brother Johann Christoph Bach, after which he continued his musical development in
                        Lüneburg.
                        From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt
                        and
                        Mühlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ
                        repertory, and Köthen, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed
                        as
                        Thomaskantor (cantor at St. Thomas) in Leipzig. He composed music for the principal Lutheran
                        churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he
                        published some of his keyboard music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier
                        positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied
                        when
                        he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus, Elector of Saxony and
                        King of
                        Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier
                        compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.</p>

                    <p class="section">Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint,
                        harmonic and motivic
                        organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from
                        Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He
                        composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns,
                        not
                        only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and sacred
                        songs. He
                        wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for
                        instance
                        for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of
                        his
                        works employ contrapuntal genres such as fugue.</p>

                    <p class="section"> Throughout the 18th century Bach was mostly renowned as an organist, while his
                        keyboard music,
                        such as The Well-Tempered Clavier, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century
                        saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his
                        known
                        music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through
                        periodicals
                        exclusively devoted to him, and publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, a numbered
                        catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further
                        popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the Air on the G String.</p>
                    <p class="section"> Musical style
                        an early age, Bach studied the works of his musical contemporaries of the Baroque period and
                        those of prior generations, and those influences were reflected in his music. Like his
                        contemporaries Handel, Telemann and Vivaldi, Bach composed concertos, suites, recitatives, da
                        capo
                        arias, and four-part choral music and employed basso continuo. Bach's music was harmonically
                        more
                        innovative than his peer composers, employing surprisingly dissonant chords and progressions,
                        often
                        with extensive exploration of harmonic possibilities within one piece.</p>

                    <p class="section">The hundreds of sacred works Bach created are usually seen as manifesting not
                        just his craft but
                        also a truly devout relationship with God. He had taught Luther's Small Catechism as the
                        Thomaskantor in Leipzig, and some of his pieces represent it. The Lutheran chorale was the
                        basis of much of his work. In elaborating these hymns into his chorale preludes, he wrote more
                        cogent and tightly integrated works than most, even when they were massive and lengthy. The
                        large-scale structure of every major Bach sacred vocal work is evidence of subtle,
                        elaborate planning to create a religiously and musically powerful expression. For example, the
                        St Matthew Passion, like other works of its kind, illustrated the Passion with Bible text
                        reflected
                        in recitatives, arias, choruses, and chorales, but in crafting this work, Bach created an
                        overall
                        experience that has been found over the intervening centuries to be both musically thrilling and
                        spiritually profound.</p>

                    <p class="section">Bach published or carefully compiled in manuscript many collections of pieces
                        that explored the
                        range of artistic and technical possibilities inherent in almost every genre of his time except
                        opera. For example, The Well-Tempered Clavier comprises two books, each of which presents a
                        prelude
                        and fugue in every major and minor key, displaying a dizzying variety of structural,
                        contrapuntal
                        and fugal techniques.</p>

                    <p class="section">Four-part harmony</p>
                    <p class="section">Four-part harmonies predate Bach, but he lived during a time when modal music in
                        Western
                        tradition
                        was largely supplanted in favour of the tonal system. In this system a piece of music progresses
                        from one chord to the next according to certain rules, each chord being characterised by four
                        notes.
                        The principles of four-part harmony are found not only in Bach's four-part choral music: he also
                        prescribes it for instance for the figured bass accompaniment. The new system was at the core
                        of Bach's style, and his compositions are to a large extent considered as laying down the rules
                        for
                        the evolving scheme that would dominate musical expression in the next centuries. Some examples
                        of
                        this characteristic of Bach's style and its influence:
                        When in the 1740s Bach staged his arrangement of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater, he upgraded the viola
                        part (which in the original composition plays in unison with the bass part) to fill out the
                        harmony,
                        thus adapting the composition to his four-part harmony style.</p>
                    <p class="section">When, starting in the 19th century in Russia, there was a discussion about the
                        authenticity of
                        four-part court chant settings compared to earlier Russian traditions, Bach's four-part chorale
                        settings, such as those ending his Chorale cantatas, were considered as foreign-influenced
                        models.
                        Such influence was deemed unavoidable, however.
                        Bach's insistence on the tonal system and contribution to shaping it did not imply he was less
                        at
                        ease with the older modal system and the genres associated with it: more than his contemporaries
                        (who had "moved on" to the tonal system without much exception), Bach often returned to the
                        then-antiquated modi and genres. His Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, emulating the chromatic
                        fantasia
                        genre as used by earlier composers such as Dowland and Sweelinck in D dorian mode (comparable to
                        D
                        minor in the tonal system), is an example of this.</p>

                    <p class="section">Modulation</p>
                    <p>Modulation, or changing key in the course of a piece, is another style characteristic where Bach
                        goes beyond what was usual in his time. Baroque instruments vastly limited modulation
                        possibilities:
                        keyboard instruments, prior to a workable system of temperament, limited the keys that could be
                        modulated to, and wind instruments, especially brass instruments such as trumpets and horns,
                        about a
                        century before they were fitted with valves, were tied to the key of their tuning. Bach pushed
                        the
                        limits: he added "strange tones" in his organ playing, confusing the singing, according to an
                        indictment he had to face in Arnstadt, and Louis Marchand, another early experimenter with
                        modulation, seems to have avoided confrontation with Bach because the latter went further than
                        anyone had done before. In the "Suscepit Israel" of his 1723 Magnificat, he had the trumpets in
                        E-flat play a melody in the enharmonic scale of C minor.</p>

                    <p class="section">The major development taking place in Bach's time, and to which he contributed in
                        no small way,
                        was
                        a temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed their use in all available keys (12 major
                        and 12
                        minor) and also modulation without retuning. His Capriccio on the departure of a beloved
                        brother, a
                        very early work, showed a gusto for modulation unlike any contemporary work this composition has
                        been compared to, but the full expansion came with the Well-Tempered Clavier, using all keys,
                        which Bach apparently had been developing since around 1720, the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm
                        Friedemann Bach being one of its earliest examples.</p>

                    <p class="section"> Ornamentation</p>
                    <p class="section">The second page of the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach is an ornament
                        notation and
                        performance guide that Bach wrote for his eldest son, who was nine years old at the time. Bach
                        was
                        generally quite specific on ornamentation in his compositions (where in his time much of the
                        ornamentation was not written out by composers but rather considered a liberty of the
                        performer), and his ornamentation was often quite elaborate. For instance, the "Aria" of the
                        Goldberg Variations has rich ornamentation in nearly every measure. Bach's dealing with
                        ornamentation can also be seen in a keyboard arrangement he made of Marcello's Oboe Concerto: he
                        added explicit ornamentation, which some centuries later is played by oboists when performing
                        the
                        concerto.</p>

                    <p class="section">Although Bach did not write any operas, he was not averse to the genre or its
                        ornamented vocal
                        style. In church music, Italian composers had imitated the operatic vocal style in genres such
                        as
                        the Neapolitan mass. In Protestant surroundings, there was more reluctance to adopt such a style
                        for
                        liturgical music. For instance, Kuhnau, Bach's predecessor in Leipzig, had notoriously shunned
                        opera
                        and Italian virtuoso vocal music. Bach was less moved. One of the comments after a performance
                        of his St Matthew Passion was that it all sounded much like opera.</p>

                    <p class="section">In concerted playing in Bach's time the basso continuo, consisting of instruments
                        such as organ,
                        viola da gamba or harpsichord, usually had the role of accompaniment, providing the harmonic and
                        rhythmic foundation of a piece. From the late 1720s, Bach had the organ play concertante (i.e.
                        as a
                        soloist) with the orchestra in instrumental cantata movements, a decade before Handel published
                        his first organ concertos. Apart from the 5th Brandenburg Concerto and the Triple Concerto,
                        which already had harpsichord soloists in the 1720s, Bach wrote and arranged his harpsichord
                        concertos in the 1730s, and in his sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord neither
                        instrument plays a continuo part: they are treated as equal soloists, far beyond the figured
                        bass.
                        In this sense, Bach played a key role in the development of genres such as the keyboard
                        concerto.</p>

                    <p class="section">Instrumentation</p>
                    <p class="section">Bach wrote virtuoso music for specific instruments as well as music independent
                        of
                        instrumentation.
                        For instance, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle of what has
                        been
                        written for this instrument, only within reach of accomplished players. The music fits the
                        instrument, pushing it to the full scale of its possibilities and requiring virtuosity of the
                        player
                        but without bravura. Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable, Bach
                        made
                        transcriptions for other instruments of some pieces of this collection. Similarly, for the cello
                        suites, the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument, the best of what is offered for
                        it,
                        yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites. The same applies to much of his
                        most
                        virtuoso keyboard music. Bach exploited the capabilities of an instrument to the fullest while
                        keeping the core of such music independent of the instrument on which it is performed.</p>

                    <p class="section">In this sense, it is no surprise that Bach's music is easily and often performed
                        on instruments
                        it
                        was not necessarily written for, that it is transcribed so often, and that his melodies turn up
                        in
                        unexpected places such as jazz music. Apart from this, Bach left a number of compositions
                        without
                        specified instrumentation: the canons BWV 1072–1078 fall in that category, as well as the bulk
                        of
                        the Musical Offering and the Art of Fugue.</p>

                    <p class="section">See also: List of fugal works by Johann Sebastian Bach
                        Another characteristic of Bach's style is his extensive use of counterpoint, as opposed to the
                        homophony used in his four-part Chorale settings, for example. Bach's canons, and especially his
                        fugues, are most characteristic of this style, which Bach did not invent but contributed to so
                        fundamentally that he defined it to a large extent. Fugues are as characteristic to Bach's style
                        as,
                        for instance, the Sonata form is characteristic to the composers of the Classical period.</p>

                    <p class="section">These strictly contrapuntal compositions, and most of Bach's music in general,
                        are characterised
                        by
                        distinct melodic lines for each of the voices, where the chords formed by the notes sounding at
                        a
                        given point follow the rules of four-part harmony. Forkel, Bach's first biographer, gives this
                        description of this feature of Bach's music, which sets it apart from most other music:
                        If the language of music is merely the utterance of a melodic line, a simple sequence of musical
                        notes, it can justly be accused of poverty. The addition of a Bass puts it upon a harmonic
                        foundation and clarifies it, but defines rather than gives it added richness. A melody so
                        accompanied—even though all the notes are not those of the true Bass—or treated with simple
                        embellishments in the upper parts, or with simple chords, used to be called "homophony." But it
                        is a
                        very different thing when two melodies are so interwoven that they converse together like two
                        persons upon a footing of pleasant equality. In the first case the accompaniment is subordinate,
                        and
                        serves merely to support the first or principal part. In the second case the two parts are not
                        similarly related. New melodic combinations spring from their interweaving, out of which new
                        forms
                        of musical expression emerge. If more parts are interwoven in the same free and independent
                        manner,
                        the apparatus of language is correspondingly enlarged, and becomes practically inexhaustible if,
                        in
                        addition, varieties of form and rhythm are introduced. Hence harmony becomes no longer a mere
                        accompaniment of melody, but rather a potent agency for augmenting the richness and
                        expressiveness
                        of musical conversation. To serve that end a simple accompaniment will not suffice. True harmony
                        is
                        the interweaving of several melodies, which emerge now in the upper, now in the middle, and now
                        in
                        the lower parts.</p>

                    <p class="section">From about the year 1720, when he was thirty-five, until his death in 1750,
                        Bach's harmony
                        consists
                        in this melodic interweaving of independent melodies, so perfect in their union that each part
                        seems
                        to constitute the true melody. Herein Bach excels all the composers in the world. At least, I
                        have
                        found no one to equal him in music known to me. Even in his four-part writing we can, not
                        infrequently, leave out the upper and lower parts and still find the middle parts melodious and
                        agreeable.</p>

                    <p class="section">Structure and lyrics</p>
                    <p class="section">Bach devoted more attention than his contemporaries to the structure of
                        compositions. This can be
                        seen in minor adjustments he made when adapting someone else's composition, such as his earliest
                        version of the "Keiser" St Mark Passion, where he enhances scene transitions, and in the
                        architecture of his own compositions such as his Magnificat and Leipzig Passions. In the last
                        years of his life, Bach revised several of his prior compositions. Often the recasting of such
                        previously composed music in an enhanced structure was the most visible change, as in the Mass
                        in B
                        minor. Bach's known preoccupation with structure led (peaking around the 1970s) to various
                        numerological analyses of his compositions, although many such over-interpretations were later
                        rejected, especially when wandering off into symbolism-ridden hermeneutics.</p>

                    <p class="section">The librettos, or lyrics, of his vocal compositions played an important role for
                        Bach. He sought
                        collaboration with various text authors for his cantatas and major vocal compositions, possibly
                        writing or adapting such texts himself to make them fit the structure of the composition he was
                        designing when he could not rely on the talents of other text authors. His collaboration with
                        Picander for the St Matthew Passion libretto is best known, but there was a similar process in
                        achieving a multi-layered structure for his St John Passion libretto a few years earlier.</p>

                    <p class="section">Compositions</p>
                    <p class="section">Paganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which
                        profoundly
                        influenced the evolution of violin technique. His 24 Caprices were likely composed in the period
                        between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this
                        period,
                        he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar,
                        either
                        as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the
                        publication,
                        in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including Le Streghe,
                        The
                        Carnival of Venice, and Nel cor più non mi sento, were composed, or at least first performed,
                        before
                        his European concert tour.</p>

                    <p class="section">Generally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the
                        timbre of the
                        instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical
                        instruments
                        and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled Il Fandango Spanolo (The
                        Spanish
                        Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was
                        a
                        solo piece Duetto Amoroso, in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on
                        the
                        violin. There survives a manuscript of the Duetto, which has been recorded. The existence of the
                        Fandango is known only through concert posters.</p>

                    <p class="section">However, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true
                        polyphonism, as pointed
                        out
                        by Eugène Ysaÿe. Yehudi Menuhin, on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the
                        result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition. The
                        orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of
                        the
                        soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as Giovanni
                        Paisiello, Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti, who were influenced by the guitar-song
                        milieu of
                        Naples during this period.</p>

                    <p class="section">Paganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both "La
                        Campanella" and the A
                        minor
                        Caprice (No. 24) have been an object of interest for a number of composers. Franz Liszt, Robert
                        Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Boris Blacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, George
                        Rochberg
                        and Witold Lutosławski, among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.</p>

                    <p class="section">Violin technique</p>

                    <p class="section">Bust of Niccolò Paganini by David d'Angers (1830–1833)
                        The Israeli violinist Ivry Gitlis once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a
                        development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present,
                        most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. Arcangelo
                        Corelli (1653–1713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble
                        instrument
                        to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly
                        established through the Sonatas and Partitas BWV 1001–1006 of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750).
                        Other notable violinists included Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741) and Giuseppe Tartini (1692–1770),
                        who,
                        in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist.
                        Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in
                        violin
                        technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were
                        still
                        considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.</p>

                    <p class="section">Much of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two
                        violinists, Pietro
                        Locatelli (1693–1746) and August Duranowski (Auguste Frédéric Durand) (1770–1834). During
                        Paganini's
                        study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled L'arte di nuova
                        modulazione –
                        Capricci enigmatici or The art of the new style – the enigmatic caprices). Published in the
                        1730s,
                        they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten
                        by
                        the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of Giovanni
                        Battista
                        Viotti (1755–1824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics and
                        the
                        left hand pizzicato in his performance. Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and
                        showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was
                        instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now
                        incorporated into regular compositions.</p>

                    <p class="section">Another aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had
                        exceptionally
                        long
                        fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an
                        extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a
                        result
                        of Marfan syndrome.</p>

                    <p class="section">Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German
                        composer and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the classical and romantic eras
                        in
                        classical music, he remains one of the most recognized and influential musicians of this period,
                        and
                        is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time.</p>

                    <p class="section">Beethoven was born in Bonn, the capital of the Electorate of Cologne, and part of
                        the Holy Roman
                        Empire. He displayed his musical talents at an early age and was vigorously taught by his father
                        Johann van Beethoven, and was later taught by composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe. At
                        age
                        21, he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn. Beethoven then gained a
                        reputation
                        as a virtuoso pianist, and was soon courted by Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which
                        resulted in
                        Opus 1 in 1795.</p>

                    <p class="section">The piece was a great critical and commercial success, and was followed by
                        Symphony No. 1 in
                        1800.
                        This composition was distinguished for its frequent use of sforzandi, as well as sudden shifts
                        in
                        tonal centers that were uncommon for traditional symphonic form, and the prominent, more
                        independent
                        use of wind instruments. In 1801, he also gained notoriety for his six String Quartets and for
                        the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate,
                        but he
                        continued to conduct, premiering his third and fifth symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively.
                        His
                        condition worsened to almost complete deafness by 1811, and he then gave up performing and
                        appearing
                        in public.</p>

                    <p class="section">During this period of self exile, Beethoven composed many of his most admired
                        works; his seventh
                        symphony premiered in 1813, with its second movement, Allegretto, achieving widespread critical
                        acclaim. He composed the piece Missa Solemnis for a number of years until it premiered 1824,
                        which preceded his ninth symphony, with the latter gaining fame for being among the first
                        examples
                        of a choral symphony. In 1826, his fourteenth String Quartet was noted for having seven linked
                        movements played without a break, and is considered the final major piece performed before his
                        death
                        a year later.</p>

                    <p class="section">His career is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods; the
                        "early" period is
                        typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to 1812, and the "late" period
                        from
                        1812 to his death in 1827. During his life, he composed nine symphonies; five piano concertos;
                        one
                        violin concerto; thirty-two piano sonatas; sixteen string quartets; two masses; and the opera
                        Fidelio. Other works, like Für Elise, were discovered after his death, and are also considered
                        historical musical achievements. Beethoven's legacy is characterized for his innovative
                        compositions, namely through the combinations of vocals and instruments, and also for widening
                        the
                        scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartet, while he is also noted for his troublesome
                        relationship with his contemporaries.</p>
                    <p class="section">Music</p>
                    <p class="section">Beethoven is acknowledged to be one of the giants of classical music. Together
                        with Bach and
                        Johannes Brahms, he is referred to as one of the "three Bs" who epitomize that tradition. He was
                        a
                        pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical classicism to 19th century
                        romanticism, and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound. His music
                        features twice on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of
                        the
                        images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two Voyager
                        probes.</p>
                    <p class="section">Overview</p>
                    <p class="section">Beethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument
                        combinations. His
                        works
                        for symphony orchestra include nine symphonies (of which the Ninth Symphony includes a chorus),
                        and
                        about a dozen pieces of "occasional" music. He wrote seven concerti for one or more soloists and
                        orchestra, as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra. His
                        only
                        opera is Fidelio; other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two masses and a
                        number of
                        shorter works.</p>

                    <p class="section">His large body of compositions for piano includes 32 piano sonatas and numerous
                        shorter pieces,
                        including arrangements of some of his other works. Works with piano accompaniment include 10
                        violin
                        sonatas, 5 cello sonatas, and a sonata for French horn, as well as numerous lieder.</p>

                    <p class="section">He also wrote a significant quantity of chamber music. In addition to 16 string
                        quartets, he
                        wrote
                        five works for string quintet, seven for piano trio, five for string trio, and more than a dozen
                        works for various combinations of wind instruments.</p>

                    <p class="section">The three periods
                        Beethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods.
                        The
                        "early" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to 1812, and
                        the
                        "late" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after his
                        death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the
                        development of Beethoven's work.</p>

                    <p class="section">Beethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary,
                        period. His earliest
                        known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are
                        known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790
                        are
                        three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's
                        sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a
                        number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music
                        (including movements of symphonies and a violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber
                        works) is conservative and uninspired.</p>

                    <p class="section">The conventional "first period" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in
                        1792. In the first
                        few
                        years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not
                        published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known
                        today
                        from Haydn and Mozart) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger
                        in
                        scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically
                        he
                        uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often includes dramatic, even
                        sometimes
                        over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led
                        Haydn
                        to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.</p>

                    <p class="section">He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of
                        his work. Some
                        important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies, the set of six
                        string
                        quartets Opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so piano sonatas,
                        including
                        the famous Pathétique sonata, Op. 13.</p>

                    <p class="section">His middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by
                        his recognition
                        of
                        encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle.
                        Middle-period
                        works include six symphonies, the last two piano concertos, the Triple Concerto and
                        violin concerto, five string quartets, several piano sonatas (including the Waldstein
                        and Appassionata sonatas), the Kreutzer violin sonata and his only opera, Fidelio.</p>

                    <p class="section">Beethoven's late period began around 1815. Works from this period are
                        characterised by their
                        intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The
                        String Quartet, Op. 131 has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to
                        the
                        orchestra in the last movement. Other compositions from this period include the Missa solemnis,
                        the last five string quartets (including the massive Große Fuge) and the last five piano
                        sonatas.</p>

                    <p class="section">Character</p>
                    <p class="section">The Beethoven Monument in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of his 75th
                        anniversary. It
                        was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied
                        the
                        unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original Beethovenhalle in Bonn
                        (it
                        was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of Franz Liszt). A statue to
                        Mozart
                        had been unveiled in Salzburg, Austria in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue
                        until
                        1880. His is the only name inscribed on one of the plaques that trim Symphony Hall, Boston; the
                        others were left empty because it was felt that only Beethoven's popularity would endure.</p>

                    <p class="section"> There is a museum, the Beethoven House, the place of his birth, in central Bonn.
                        The same city
                        has
                        hosted a musical festival, the Beethovenfest, since 1845. The festival was initially irregular
                        but
                        has been organised annually since 2007.

                        The Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies serves as a museum, research center, and host
                        of
                        lectures and performances devoted solely to this life and works.

                        The third largest crater on Mercury is named in his honour, as is the main-belt asteroid 1815
