                        Sheldon is tall and thin, he is called "Mantis" and "Giraffe".
                        Sheldon wears t-shirts featuring characters from the Marvel and DC comics universe, including
                        the Flash, Aquaman, Superman, Green Lantern, Green arrow, Batman, Captain marvel. He also
                        sometimes
                        wears t-shirts in different colors with the image of his favorite number-73. He usually wears a
                        longsleeve (long sleeve t-shirt) under his t-shirt. Sheldon also often appears in t-shirts with
                        drawings in the
                        form of different television setup tables. At lectures and public appearances, Sheldon wears a
                        plaid
                        suit. His pajamas and robe were the same color.</div>

                <div class="unit">personality </div>
                <div class="meat">
                    IQ is 187, and he has an eidetic memory. Judging by the anecdotal comments, he has an extensive
                    supply of knowledge about a lot of things. Nevertheless, Sheldon is extremely weak in everything
                    related to social intelligence. Sheldon has a number of qualities that are usually manifested in
                    people with autism spectrum
                    disorders, such as weak social activity, lack of empathy, anancastic personality disorder and many
                    other
                    features that make him one of the most eccentric and bizarre characters in the series, Sheldon's
                    behavior
                    is largely consistent with Syndrome Asperger. Features of his character include: Synesthesia.
                    Sheldon intuitively senses prime numbers. Speaking of her favorite number, Sheldon
                    explains: “73 is the 21st prime number. Written on the contrary, it is 37 - this is the 12th
                    prime number, and if you write it on the contrary - 21, it is the result of multiplying seven and
                    three, and also the number 73 written in the binary number system is a palindrome: 1-0-0-1-0 -0-1. "
                    Anancastous personality disorder: Sheldon has a strict adherence to the schedule of his
                    activities: eating, visiting the bathroom, performing his duties or doing laundry - all according to
                    the
                    schedule. Narcissism: Sheldon often feels the need for admiration for his own person and constantly
                    indicates his intellectual superiority. Misophobia: worries if someone touches his food or himself,
                    washes his hands as often as he can,
                    and takes a shower twice a day. Hypochondria: Sheldon is often worried about getting sick. Inability
                    to lie: When Sheldon
                    becomes an accomplice in a lie, he tries to make every effort to make what is said believable, but
                    often
                    brings it to the point of absurdity. Unable to keep secrets.

                            class="personality picture"></div>
                    Inability to sit in different places: Sheldon refuses to sit anywhere other than his own place
                    on the couch in his apartment, which he considers “the only point of permanence in a changing world”
                    and “a special place in the space around which the entire Universe revolves.” Intolerance of people
                    in
                    their bedroom. Pathological hoarding. Fear of the scene. Although Sheldon can quite easily speak
                    with
                    small groups, he cannot communicate with the crowd. Sheldon's phobias - dogs, birds and nets.
                    Sheldon has some “childish” qualities. He, it would seem, does not understand this and considers
                    this a way to achieve his goal. Sheldon drinks alcohol only in exceptional cases, and he tries not
                    to drink caffeine and some
                    other substances at all. Sheldon adheres to a strict diet: he eats certain foods on certain days
                    (for example, “pizza
                    evening”, “Thai food evening”), and his food has specific features, for example, a certain type of
                    mustard, chopped broccoli instead of grated, a certain order of ingredients in a sandwich etc.
                    Hobbies Like his fellow scientists, Sheldon loves comics, video games and science fiction. He is
                    a fan of many films and TV shows (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Cruiser"

                    Sheldon’s favorite character is Spock from the Star Trek
                    series, because they have a
                    lot in common: they are very smart, practically do not express their emotions and hate to break the
                    rules. Sheldon has absolute pitch and can immediately play any melody on any instrument, with the
                    exception of the violin. He plays on: piano (synthesizer); flute; theremin; bongo; tuba; bass
                    guitar.
                    In addition, she owns <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B9"
                        target="_blank">Tuvan throat singing</a>. However, he never studied music purposefully, as he is
                    convinced that all musicians are drug
                    addicts. Sheldon has a “strike” system if someone violates his rules. If one person receives three
                    “strikes”, he gives him a choice: either apologize or attend his lectures.
                    One of Sheldon’s biggest dreams is a visit LHC (<a

                            mother.

                    Being among friends, Sheldon does not show interest in the formation of social relations of any
                    kind with anyone and is pleased with his current circle of friends.
                    Despite Sheldon's lack of interest of a romantic or sexual nature, he somehow managed to attract
                    the attention of at least four women and one man. However, each time he did not completely
                    understand the situation. Sheldon can chat with a limited number of friends in his social
                    circle.
                    His best friend, Leonard, is at the same time his flatmate.
