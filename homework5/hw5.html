                                First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized
                                language, and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to
                                a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow fall into madness. The lover, often
                                identified as a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a
                                bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further distress the protagonist with its constant
                                repetition of the word "Nevermore". The poem makes use of folk, mythological, religious,
                                and classical references.

                                Magazine. Fearing the story was indecent, the magazine's editor deleted roughly
                                five hundred words before publication without Wilde's knowledge. Despite that
                                censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book

                                Poe, first published in 1843. It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to
                                convince the reader of the narrator’s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder
                                the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy "vulture-eye", as the
                                narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder,
                                attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the
                                floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance,
                                result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's
                                beating heart.

                                Amontillado") is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in
                                the November 1846 issue of Godey's Lady's Book. The story, set in an unnamed Italian
                                city at carnival time in an unspecified year, is about a man taking fatal revenge on a
                                friend who, he believes, has insulted him. Like several of Poe's stories, and in keeping
                                with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative revolves around a
                                person being buried alive – in this case, by immurement. As in "The Black Cat" and "The
                                Tell-Tale Heart", Poe conveys the story from the murderer's perspective.

                            <span class="hidden">Carmilla is an 1872 Gothic novella by Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le
                                Fanu and one of the early works of vampire fiction, predating Bram Stoker's Dracula
                                (1897) by 26 years. First published as a serial in The Dark Blue (1871–72),[1][2] the
                                story is narrated by a young woman preyed upon by a female vampire named Carmilla, later
                                revealed to be Mircalla, Countess Karnstein (Carmilla is an anagram of Mircalla). The
                                character is a prototypical example of the lesbian vampire, expressing romantic desires
                                toward the protagonist, and is depicted as a trait of antagonism in line with the
                                contemporary views of homosexuality.[3][4] The story is often anthologized and has been
                                adapted many times in film and other media.
